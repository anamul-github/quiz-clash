### About this Project: ###

* I created some routes, fetched API data and loaded them in route to show in another component. It is a quiz taking application. There are 4 skills on that Quiz, which anyone can take. If anyone click "Start Quiz", it will open up in another component. 

* I also showed options for the quiz. If they click any option, it will show it a toast whether it is correct or wrong.
